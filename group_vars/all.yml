  # NOTE: When you execute the command `ansible-playbook local.yml`, the specified
  # roles will run. However, there is an exception: the `common` role will also
  # execute because it is a dependency for the `cli` role. You can confirm this
  # by reviewing the `main.yml` file located in the `meta` directory of the
  # `cli` role.

  # NOTE: You can run roles that are not explicitly listed here by using the
  # following command: `ansible-playbook local.yml --tags ssh` to execute
  # only the `ssh` role. Keep in mind that if the role has `meta` constraints,
  # they will be also executed.
